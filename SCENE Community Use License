# SCENE License (Community-Led Use and Accountability License)

## Preamble

This license is rooted in justice, dignity, and liberation. The SCENE application and its code, content, and community-driven mission are intended to support system-impacted individuals, particularly Black, Brown, Indigenous, and marginalized communities. This is not a product. This is a tool for resistance, protection, and transformation. You are not being watched. You are being seen.

## Permissions

You are **free to**:

- **Use** this project to build tools for transparency, accountability, and community safety.
- **Adapt** the code and structure for aligned purposes that prioritize non-carceral, non-punitive approaches.
- **Share** the project or your adaptations with proper attribution.
- **Collaborate** to improve, refine, or expand the SCENE ecosystem under the guidelines below.

## Conditions

To use this code, you must:

- **Attribute** the project and its original authors in any public or published form.
- **Honor Community Intent**: This project may not be used by, for, or in service of law enforcement, military, or surveillance contractors.
- **Protect Privacy**: You must not use this project to track, target, or harm individuals or communities.
- **Uphold Equity**: Projects built from SCENE must consider and mitigate harm, center those most impacted, and be trauma-informed.

## Prohibited Uses

You may **not**:

- Deploy SCENE or its derivatives for **predictive policing**, **facial recognition**, or any form of **punitive surveillance**.
- Monetize this project in a way that exploits or profits from surveillance-impacted communities.
- Sell, license, or package SCENE code under proprietary or closed licenses.
- Use this project for lobbying, funding, or promotion that contradicts abolitionist or equity-based values.

## Community Accountability

This project exists in solidarity with system-impacted people. We reject punitive enforcement systems. Instead:

- If misuse is discovered, we will **call in** users or contributors through direct community dialogue.
- Violations of this license may result in **removal from collaborators**, revocation of access, and public documentation of misuse.
- We invite and empower the community to **document and report misuse**, support restorative education, and share models of transformative justice.

## Commercial Licensing

- Commercial partnerships, licensing, or enterprise use is not covered by this license. Interested entities must contact the project maintainer(s) to enter into a separate agreement.

This approach reflects our commitment to building technology that reflects care, protection, and radical inclusion—not punishment.


## Final Note

SCENE is rooted in lived experience, resistance, and love. Use this code as a tool for liberation—not control. If you can’t agree to that, you don’t get to use it.
