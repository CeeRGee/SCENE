1. Purpose

This policy establishes how the name SCENE and its acronym meanings may be used, attributed, and represented in all public, private, nonprofit, academic, or technological contexts. SCENE was created by and for communities impacted by surveillance, policing, and carceral systems. Its intent must never be diluted, exploited, or repurposed for agendas that contradict its mission of liberation, equity, and community empowerment.

No other meanings or interpretations may be used or published without written consent.

3. Approved Usage

SCENE may be used by individuals or organizations only if:
- They publicly credit SCENE as the originator.
- The usage aligns with SCENE’s stated mission and community values.
- Any use of acronym variations must remain true to its original spirit: anti-surveillance, anti-carceral, pro-community empowerment.
- A formal use request is submitted to the SCENE team for review.

4. Prohibited Usage

Use of the SCENE name, acronym, or associated language is strictly prohibited for:
- Law enforcement agencies, surveillance contractors, or predictive policing firms.
- Government entities or political campaigns without written approval.
- Projects that reinforce incarceration, policing, punishment, or surveillance-based public safety models.
- Commercial uses without licensing or partnership agreement.
- Any use that waters down, rebrands, or reframes SCENE to erase its abolitionist and justice-centered roots.

5. Attribution Guidelines

When SCENE is cited, used in media, or featured in a project, the following attribution must be included:

"SCENE – Safety, Community, Empowerment, and [insert relevant version] was developed to protect, uplift, and empower system-impacted communities."
Logos, icons, and taglines may not be modified or reproduced without express permission.

6. Community Accountability
SCENE reserves the right to:
- Issue takedown notices
- Publicly call out misuses
- Pursue legal action if necessary
- Revoke usage rights at any time if the user violates this policy

7. Clarifying Boundaries Without Erasure

SCENE acknowledges that many people in our communities continue to call law enforcement, rely on courts, or believe in legal remedies as forms of justice. These responses are often shaped by a lack of alternatives, histories of harm, and systemic disempowerment.

However, SCENE was not created to affirm or normalize those systems. It is a space to explore what safety, accountability, and justice can look like outside of traditional law enforcement and carceral institutions.

8. Legal Action & Strategic Use of State Systems

SCENE is not a tool for promoting or reinforcing carceral institutions. However, some of SCENE’s services—including evidence collection, documentation, and support—may be used in legal actions such as lawsuits, civil complaints, or demands for public accountability.

We do not shy away from using the courts as a battleground, especially when it means:
- Exposing misconduct by law enforcement or government agencies.
- Supporting survivors in bringing civil rights claims.
- Demanding transparency, policy change, or reparative outcomes.

This is not an endorsement of the justice system—it’s a recognition that some forms of public resistance and protection require legal action.
No one using SCENE should confuse legal strategy with systemic approval.
