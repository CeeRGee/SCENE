## 1. Shared Purpose

This project exists to build SCENE: a community accountability platform centered on safety, visibility, and empowerment—especially for those historically harmed by systems of surveillance and criminalization.

We are working together to grow this project in alignment with abolitionist values, collective care, and technological responsibility.

---

## 2. Roles and Flexibility

One or more contributor/s may currently serve as the project initiator or lead. Roles and responsibilities are flexible and subject to change as the project develops and contributions evolve. We agree to revisit expectations and scope regularly.

---

## 3. Mutual Respect and Integrity

We commit to:
- Open and honest communication
- Respecting each other’s ideas and boundaries
- Addressing disagreements in good faith
- Uplifting community-first approaches to design and tech

---

## 4. Creative Direction

Initial decisions on design, data use, and deployment may be made by the project initiator/s for clarity and cohesion. However, all collaborators are encouraged to contribute ideas, raise concerns, and participate in shaping the direction.

---

## 5. Credit and Contribution

All contributions will be acknowledged. Credit and authorship will be discussed transparently and adjusted as needed. We agree that meaningful, sustained contributions may lead to shared ownership as the project matures.

No individual or entity will seek to profit from SCENE without open dialogue and community accountability.

---

## 6. Trust and Accountability

This understanding is a living document meant to guide collaboration—not a contract. If things shift, we talk. If something doesn’t sit right, we pause. This is about building with intention, flexibility, and respect.
